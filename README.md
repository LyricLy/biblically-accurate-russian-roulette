# It's exactly what you think it is
By that I mean it's a Discord bot specifically for playing mildly accurate russian roulette**ยน**. Don't even ask.

**ยน**: As accurate as a PRNG-driven cylinder can be, at the very least.

# How do I run it, though?
It's really, really simple. There's honestly nothing much to say.

- Have `poetry` installed.
- Clone this repostory and `cd` into it.
- Install dependencies with `poetry install`.
- Run `poetry run python3 bot.py -- --token ...`, replacing `...` with your actual token.
- ???
- That's genuinely it.

# Will my cranium ever recover?
Probably not. Sorry.
